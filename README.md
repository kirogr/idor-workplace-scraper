# IDOR Vulnerability in Workplace Portal

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

## üõ† The Vulnerability
While exploring a workplace portal, I discovered an **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)** vulnerability that allowed unauthorized access to employee-sensitive data.

### üîç How It Works
- Each workplace has a unique numeric place id (`/EmployeeList.aspx?place_id=123`)
- The system does NOT check if the logged-in user is authorized to access other workplaces.
- Changing the `place_id` in the URL lets anyone see employees' full names, emails, and phone numbers.

### üï∏Ô∏è The Scraper
This script is for educational and research purposes only and demonstrates how an insecure IDOR implementation can expose sensitive workplace data.
- It shows how an attacker could enumerate workplaces using sequential `place_id` values.
- The script is designed to highlight the security flaw IDOR, not to be used for malicious purposes.
- No real credentials, exploits, or unauthorized actions are included.

**üìå Companies should fix this issue by implementing proper authorization checks to restrict access to sensitive data.**
